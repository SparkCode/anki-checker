# Project Brief: Anki Checker

## Overview
Anki Checker appears to be a web application designed to help users check and process content for Anki flashcards. Based on the project structure, it's a React application that potentially offers functionality to validate, format, or enhance Anki card content.

## Core Requirements
- Provide a user interface for checking and processing Anki flashcard content
- Validate and verify flashcard data for correctness
- Possibly handle transcription or conversion of content (based on transcriptionUtils)
- Interface with Anki or Anki-compatible systems through APIs

## Goals
- Simplify the process of creating and verifying Anki flashcards
- Ensure accuracy and consistency in flashcard content
- Improve user workflow when working with Anki flashcards
- Create a reliable tool for Anki users to enhance their flashcard creation process

## Technical Scope
- React-based front-end web application
- RESTful API integration (potentially with Anki or other services)
- Text processing and validation functionality
- Possibly audio/transcription handling

This project brief will be refined as more details about the specific functionality and requirements of Anki Checker become clear through further exploration and implementation.
