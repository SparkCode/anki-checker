# Progress: Anki Checker

## Current Status
The Memory Bank has been initialized for the Anki Checker project. Recent development has focused on changing the AI model used by the application from Claude 3.7 Sonnet to ChatGPT-4o through the OpenRouter API.

## What Works
Based on the project structure, the following components appear to be implemented:

- **Core React Application Structure**: Standard Create React App structure is in place
- **AnkiForm Component**: Main user interface component exists
- **API Service**: Service layer for API communication is implemented
- **Transcription Utilities**: Helper functions for text processing are available
- **Testing Framework**: Tests are in place for components, services, and utilities

## What's Left to Build
As we are in the initial documentation phase, we need more information to determine what remains to be built. Potential areas include:

- **Additional UI Components**: Depending on the application's intended scope
- **Enhanced Validation**: Possible improvements to the validation system
- **Extended Transcription Capabilities**: If needed based on user requirements
- **Improved Error Handling**: For more robust application behavior
- **UI/UX Enhancements**: For better user experience

## Known Issues
No specific issues have been identified yet as we are in the initial documentation phase. This section will be updated as we explore the codebase and functionality.
