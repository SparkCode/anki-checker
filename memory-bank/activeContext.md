# Active Context: Anki Checker

## Current Focus
The current focus is on API service configuration and model selection. We've recently updated the AI model used for checking answers.

## Recent Changes
- Initialized the Memory Bank directory
- Created core Memory Bank files to document the project
- Changed the AI model from Claude 3.7 Sonnet to ChatGPT-4o using OpenRouter API

## Next Steps
The following next steps are anticipated for this project:

1. **Explore Existing Codebase**:
   - Review component implementation (especially AnkiForm.js)
   - Analyze API service implementation
   - Understand transcription utilities functionality

2. **Enhance Functionality**:
   - Identify potential improvements to the current implementation
   - Consider additional features that might enhance user experience
   - Address any existing bugs or issues

3. **Documentation**:
   - Further refine Memory Bank documentation as we learn more about the implementation
   - Document code if not already done

## Active Decisions
As this is the initial setup of the Memory Bank, no active decisions have been documented yet. This section will be updated as development decisions are made or discussed.

## Current Considerations
- Understanding the specific Anki-related functionality this checker provides
- Determining how transcription utilities are used in the application
- Understanding the API integration and backend dependencies
- Identifying any existing issues or areas for improvement
- Learning about user feedback if available
- Exploring potential enhancements to the application

This active context will be updated as we gain more insights into the current state of the project and ongoing development priorities.
